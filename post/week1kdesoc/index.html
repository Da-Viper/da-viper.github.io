            <p>The first week was small steps were made,</p>
<p>some printers for QT and KDE framework was already made,i imported those printers <a href="https://invent.kde.org/kdevelop/kdevelop/-/tree/master/plugins/gdb/printers">from here</a>, also some from a qt merge request patch <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/87052/">here</a>,</p>
<p>removing any deprecated logic as the printers are quite old, some changes where made to the QListPrinter to fix the indexing and to account for typedefs like QStringList, QVariantList.</p>
<p>I had a problem of QListprinters not printing nested list,</p>
<p>for example you have a declared a variable</p>
<p><code>QList&lt;QList&lt;QString&gt;&gt; nestedList = { {&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;,&quot;three&quot;,&quot;four&quot;}, {&quot;aword&quot;, &quot;anotherone&quot;, &quot;yetanother&quot;, &quot;anoyetanother&quot;}};</code></p>
<p>the QListPrinter does not recognized this yet</p>
<ul>
<li>A new printer for QAtomic int is added</li>
</ul>
<p>Update by next week</p>
