        <p>I think i went down a rabbit hole</p>
<p>I decided the next printer to make is QDir,</p>
<p>I had to understand how things works,
making printers feels like construction,
its like you are given a set of tools, to produce an output.</p>
<p>The normal steps i take make a printer is to either dereference  d_ptr value or the d value ( they are usuallly included in QT types) , to use <code>ptype nameOfTheValue</code>  but in both cases the output was an incomplete type.</p>
<p>After a little search, thanks to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56313562">answer</a> from stackoverflow i was able to get the debugging symbols needed to view the internals of the QDir class.</p>
<p>next problem was getting the list of files in the directory show consistently, the files list only show up in gdb when either the method <code>QDir-&gt;entryList()</code> or <code>QDir-&gt;count()</code> has been called previously, i then decided to call the entryList method when the printer is initialized that way the file list is always shown when QDir is called in GDB.</p>
<p>But the entire application would crash if the QDir has not yet been initialized in memory, because the method i am trying to call does not exist. since none of Qt classes have any fields named something like initialiized, could not find anything for sometime. I was able to figure out that most <em>advanced</em> Qt classes usually have a field named QSharedData.</p>
<p>In QShareddata there is usually a field named ref that only has the value of one when the variable has been initialized, i was able to use that to make a condition statement to print the filelist of the directory if it is iniitalized.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Pretty printer for QFileInfo was added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Pretty Printer for QstringRef was added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the repo can be found <a href="https://invent.kde.org/ebuka/gdb_printers">here</a></p>
<p>Next week would be Pointers Printer
Goodbye</p>
